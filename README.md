# Expo ImagePicker Null URI Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo ImagePicker library where the selected image URI is occasionally returned as null on Android devices.  The bug is intermittent and doesn't appear to be consistently reproducible across all devices.

## Bug Description

The core problem is that after a user selects an image using `ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync()`, the returned `uri` property is sometimes `null` even when an image has been successfully selected. This inconsistency causes unexpected behavior in apps that rely on the image URI to process or display the selected image. This issue is particularly problematic because it's not easily debugged and may affect some users randomly. 

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the app on an Android emulator or device.
3. Try selecting multiple images. You might encounter instances where the selected image URI is `null`.

## Solution

The solution involves adding error handling to gracefully manage cases where the URI is `null`.  This prevents app crashes and provides a more robust user experience. The solution involves checking for null and providing alternative handling or feedback to the user.
